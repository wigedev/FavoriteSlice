# FavoriteSlice
Cross platform app for rating your favorite pizza place.

This is an initial, proof of concept app not intended for wide distribution. This app will serve as a testing platform
for experimenting with Node.js and React Native.

###Version 0.1
Includes the ability to add and remove pizzarias, and enter ratings. Uses the inbuilt database to store information.

will be done through the applicable app stores.

###TODO
* Remove from Expo and use full native capabilities
* Add a database to store ratings and historical information
* Add geocoding service to enable discovery of local pizzarias.
* Add ability to order directly from app
* Add ability to navigate to pizzaria directly from app
